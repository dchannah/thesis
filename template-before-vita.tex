% In spite of the effort to accommodate this template and the nuthesis
% class to the official requirements of the university to write a 
% Ph.D. dissertation, it is not possible to guarantee that it will 
% always work, and the author of the dissertation remains responsible
% for checking that such requirements are actually fulfilled by 
% his/her final work.

% Alternatively, you may write the chapters in separate

% with commands:

%\include{chap1}

%\include{chap2}

% The command \includeonly above allows to include a selected 
% set of chapters only.

% Uncomment the 'singlespace' environment and '\bibsep' command
% if needed - some bibliographic styles overide the definition
% of 'thebibliography' in nuthesis.cls

% (The following suggested by Francisco Iacobelli - 5/11/2010)
% In case, you want to use BibTeX, you should replace (or comment)

% Instead uncomment the following 3 lines and replace <bib file>
% with your .bib file:

%\renewcommand\refname{\begin{centering}References\end{centering}}
%\bibliographystyle{achemso} %or another suitable style.
%\bibliography{diss}
