\chapter{Hot electron cooling in plasmonic nanomaterials}

\section{Introduction}

	In this chapter we explore similar phenomena in plasmonic nanomaterials.

\subsection{Overview of plasmon cooling dynamics}

	Basic stuff like the TA bleach and what corresponds to what (can be taken from PNAS).

\subsection{The two-temperature model}

	More from PNAS on TTM.

\section{The effect of surface chemistry on plasmon-phonon thermalization}

	Note that TTM doesn't account for this despite how many atoms on surface.

\subsection{Experimental characterization of plasmon-phonon thermalization}

	Show TA data for thiol and amine capped, note incompatibility with TTM.  Also cover me and Mike's work in this section.

\subsection{Theoretical studies of the impact of surface chemistry on electron heat capacity}

	Theory section of PNAS paper and anything I do for Mike.
